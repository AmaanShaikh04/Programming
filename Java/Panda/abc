1. We first install and setup two virtual machines, here we have taken Windows XP as the target and Kali Linux as the attacker.
2. We then have to setup the network on the two VMs to make sure they both are in the same network and both of them get IP address.
3. Then we power on both the VMs.
4. Switch to Windows XP and open command prompt and type ipconfig to get its IP address.
5. Switch to Kali Linux and open terminal and type /sbin/ifconfig to get its IP address.
6. Then we ping and check if both the system are able to communicate with each other.
7. Once the pinging is successful, switch to Kali Linux and login with the superuser and start msfconsole.
8. We will be using synflood for the attack so search synflood and use synflood.
9. Set the target host at RHOSTS, set the target port at RPORT, and set the number of syns at NUM.
10. Use Wireshark to capture the packets and type exploit in the terminal to start the DoS attack.
11. Once all the syns are sent, the attack has been completed.
